### 0. COMMENTS & HELLO, WORLD!

# In Python, lines that start with a hash are `comments`. Comments are ignored
# by the interpreter and are used to explain code and leave notes for other
# human programmers

# In Python, `print` is a function used to send text to "standard output" (the terminal window)
print("hello, world!")
# > hello, world
